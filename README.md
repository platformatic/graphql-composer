# `@platformatic/graphql-composer`

The GraphQL API Composer is a framework agnostic library for combining multiple GraphQL APIs, known as subgraphs, into a single API capable of querying data across any of its constituent subgraphs.

## Example

Given the following `Books` subgraph schema:

```graphql
enum BookGenre {
  FICTION
  NONFICTION
}

type Book {
  id: ID!
  title: String
  genre: BookGenre
}

type Query {
  getBook(id: ID!): Book
  getBooksByIds(ids: [ID]!): [Book]!
}
```

And the following `Reviews` subgraph schema:

```graphql
input ReviewInput {
  bookId: ID!
  rating: Int!
  content: String!
}

type Review {
  id: ID!
  rating: Int!
  content: String!
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
}

type Book {
  id: ID!
  reviews: [Review]!
  author: Author
}

type ReviewWithBook {
  id: ID!
  rating: Int!
  content: String!
  book: Book!
}

type Query {
  getReview(id: ID!): Review
  getReviewBook(id: ID!): Book
  getReviewBookByIds(ids: [ID]!): [Book]!
  getReviewsByBookId(id: ID!): [Review]!
}

type Mutation {
  createReview(review: ReviewInput!): Review!
}

type Subscription {
  reviewPosted: ReviewWithBook!
}
```

The Composer will download each subgraph schema from the corresponding upstream servers. The two subgraphs will be merged to create a supergraph API. The combined API exposes the original operations from each subgraph. Furthermore, types with the same name in multiple subgraphs are merged together into entities. For example, when the `Books` and `Reviews` subgraphs are merged, the `Book` type becomes:

```graphql
type Book {
  # Common field used to uniquely identify a Book.
  id: ID!

  # Fields from the Books subgraph.
  title: String
  genre: BookGenre

  # nested types
  author: Author

  # Fields from the Reviews subgraph.
  reviews: [Review]!
}
```

The following example shows how the GraphQL API Composer can be used with Fastify and Mercurius.

```js
'use strict';
const { compose } = require('@platformatic/graphql-composer')
const Fastify = require('fastify')
const Mercurius = require('mercurius')

async function main() {
  const composer = await compose({
    subgraphs: [
      { // Books subgraph information.
        // Subgraph server to connect to.
        server: {
          host: 'localhost:3000',
          // Endpoint for retrieving introspection schema.
          composeEndpoint: '/graphql-composition',
          // Endpoint for GraphQL queries.
          graphqlEndpoint: '/graphql'
        },
        entities: {
          // Configuration for working with Book entities in this subgraph.
          Book: {
            pkey: 'id',
            // Resolver for retrieving multiple Books.
            resolver: {
              name: 'getBooksByIds',
              argsAdapter: 'ids.$>#id'
            }
          }
        },
      },
      { // Reviews subgraph information.
        ...
      }
    ],
    // Hooks for subscriptions.
    subscriptions: {
      onError (ctx, topic, error) {
        throw error;
      },
      publish (ctx, topic, payload) {
        ctx.pubsub.publish({
          topic,
          payload
        })
      },
      subscribe (ctx, topic) {
        return ctx.pubsub.subscribe(topic)
      },
      unsubscribe (ctx, topic) {
        ctx.pubsub.close()
      }
    }
  })

  // Create a Fastify server that uses the Mercurius GraphQL plugin.
  const router = Fastify()

  router.register(Mercurius, {
    schema: composer.toSdl(),
    resolvers: composer.resolvers,
    subscription: true
  })

  await router.ready()
  // If subscriptions are used, the GraphQL router's server implementation
  // should call onSubscriptionEnd() when a subscription ends. This tells
  // the composer to clean up the resources associated with the subscription.
  router.graphql.addHook('onSubscriptionEnd', composer.onSubscriptionEnd)
  await router.listen()
}

main()
```

  - Returns
    - A `Promise` that resolves with a `Composer` instance.

When this function is called, all of the subgraph schemas are retrieved and merged into a supergraph. A `Promise` resolving to a `Composer` instance is returned.

    - None
  - Returns
    - `SDL` string

Returns the SDL of the supergraph as a string; this can be passed to the GraphQL service as a schema definition.

#### `Composer.prototype.toSchema()`

  - Arguments
    - None
  - Returns
    - `IntrospectionQuery` object

Returns the supergraph schema as a GraphQL `IntrospectionQuery` object. This representation can be passed to other functions such as GraphQL's `buildClientSchema()` function.

#### `composer.resolvers`

An object containing the GraphQL resolver information for the supergraph.

#### `onSubscriptionEnd(ctx, topic)`

  - Arguments
    - `ctx` (any) - GraphQL context object.
    - `topic` (string) - The subscription topic.
  - Returns
    - Nothing

A function that should be called by the GraphQL router when a client subscription has ended.
